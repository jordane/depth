Dependencies
------------
You can get these by running `npm install`.

> default that would be `node_modules/.bin/stylus`. Add this to your path, or
> use it's full path below.

Running
-------

- Compile the Stylus files

    stylus static/css/*.stylus

- Serve the static directory with a simple HTTP server.
